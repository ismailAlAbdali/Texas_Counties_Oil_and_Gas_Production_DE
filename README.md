# Texas Railroad Commission Data Engineering Dashboard

Welcome to the Texas Railroad Commission Data Engineering Project! This repository hosts an end-to-end data engineering project that collects, transforms, and visualizes valuable data from the Railroad Commission of Texas. The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into the production of oil and gas over the years and the cumulative production within the region.

## Key Features

1. **Production Insights**: Our dashboard offers a clear view of oil and gas production trends over the years. Users can easily analyze how production has evolved annually.

2. **Filtering Capabilities**: We empower users to customize their data exploration by providing filters for district selection, oil and gas code, and monthly date ranges. This functionality makes it easy to zoom in on specific aspects of the data.

3. **Interactive Dashboard**: The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, offering an interactive experience that allows users to drill down into the data and extract actionable insights.

## Technology Stack

- **Data Collection**: Data was collected from the Texas Railroad Commission, ensuring the most accurate and up-to-date information.

- **Data Transformation**: Initial data transformation was performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook, enabling efficient data cleaning and preparation.

- **ETL Pipelines with Mage-ai**: We utilized Mage-ai, an innovative and interactive data engineering tool, to construct robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. This streamlined the process of handling complex data transformations and ensured data quality.

- **Visualization**: The data is visualized using cutting-edge visualization libraries to provide a clear and engaging presentation of the insights.
