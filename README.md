# Project Goal

## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to gain a some understanding of the **oil industry by analyzing data from the Railroad Commission of Texas**. Through this endeavor, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

### Explore Oil Industry Insights and Data Discovery
- Delve into the data to uncover valuable insights into the production of oil and gas over the years, providing a detailed understanding of production trends within the region. This process required data discovery and reading data catalogs to get some comprehensive understanding of the data.

### Learn Data Engineering
- This project serves as a learning opportunity to understand the intricacies of the data engineering process. By working on data collection, transformation, and visualization, we aim to acquire practical skills in data engineering.

### Leverage Modern Data Engineering Tools
- Embrace cutting-edge data engineering tools such as Mage-ai to streamline the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline development. This enables us to work efficiently and effectively with complex data.

### Explore Google Cloud Computing
- Utilize the power of Google Cloud Computing for data storage and processing. This project provides hands-on experience with cloud-based solutions, enhancing our knowledge of cloud computing technologies.

### Automation in Python
- Learn to utilize python tools to automate manual weekly or monthly work in order to free up some time for more creative and productive endeavors.
